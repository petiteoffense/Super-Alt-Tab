# Super Alt Tab (An AutoHotkey script)

This script creates a highly efficient, ergonomic, fluid "Super Alt Tab" key.
On tap and release, the key switches to the last used window.
If held, by default the 'i', 'j', 'k', and 'l' keys temporarily function as arrow
keys, allowing for quick window selection. When the Super Alt Tab key is
released, the highlighted window is brought forward.
When double-tapped, the Super Alt Tab key passes an alt + space command
to bring forward a Launchy prompt, if installed.
By default, Super Alt Tab is mapped to F19,
which is ideal if using a progammable keyboard like the Ergodox. However, it
should be easily reassignable to CapsLock or any other key if desired.

Note: This script should be suspended while gaming as you may have problems with the
'i', 'j', 'k', and 'l' keys, and minute latency may be introduced on mouse left click.
